    "# Lenstra's Elliptic Curve Method for Integer Factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "We note the definition of an elliptic curve in $\\R^2$ space:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We then consider the discrete analogue for a finite field with $N$ elements, namely $\\Z_N$. In this case, we say that coefficients $a,b \\in \\Z_N$. Let us call this group $E(N)$. We also set a restriction that $4a^3 + 27$ is invertible modulo $N$, ensuring that there are no singular points on the elliptic curve, which would result in the inability to draw a tangent line. Drawing tangent lines is crucial to the definition of addition under the elliptic curve group $E(N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with all points on the elliptic curve, we also consider a new, general, point called the \"point at infinity\", denoted by $\\mathcal{O}$. For our purposes, we do not utilize $\\mathcal{O}$, but nonetheless, it is recognized in point addition."
